Stability of a Delayed Predator-Prey Model for Puma Concolor

This project contains two scripts. The first generates several simulations of a delayed prey-predator system for the relationship between the Puma concolor and its prey using lag differential equations, 
a Holling type III functional response, logistic prey growth, and a Ricker-type function to model intraspecific competition. of the pumas. The second contains a function that determines the equilibrium 
points of the system and carries out a study of the stability of these solutions, supported by numerical simulations.
